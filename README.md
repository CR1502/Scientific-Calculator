# Scientific-Calculator
This is kind of a Scientific Calculator it doesn't do much, but yeah.
I've used the Module function of Python where in I've made a program that has all the calulation functions, and another which has menu driven program, from which you can choose the type of calculations you wanna perform. 
I stil have to work on it by adding a GUI and making it an executable file.
